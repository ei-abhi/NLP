Transformers are a type of deep learning model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. They have since become the cornerstone of many state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data efficiently.

The architecture of a transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both built using self-attention mechanisms. Here's a brief overview of each:

Encoder:

      The encoder consists of a stack of identical layers.
      Each layer has two sub-layers:
      Multi-head self-attention mechanism: It allows the encoder to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence.
      Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network: It applies to each position separately and identically.
      Residual connections around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.
Decoder:

      The decoder also consists of a stack of identical layers.
      Each layer in the decoder has three sub-layers:
      Masked multi-head self-attention mechanism: It allows the decoder to attend to all positions up to and including the current position.
      Multi-head attention over the encoder's output.
      Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
      Residual connections around each of the three sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.
      
The self-attention mechanism is the core concept of transformers, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating an output.

Transformers have been adapted and extended in various ways, leading to the development of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and many others, which have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks.
